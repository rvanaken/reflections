What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created in the location where "git init" is issued, but no
commit is issued yet.  "git status" indicates that nothing has been committed
but that there are untracked files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area represents git metadata about a collection of files, whereas
the directory is used by the OS to contain files.  The staging area provides a
mechanism that allows a single commit to operate on a collection of files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

If several source files are involved in a logical change, they can all be
staged and committed in a single commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Radical new work could take a substantial amount of time to complete.  With a
single branch you would not be able to do maintenance until you complete the
new work.  A new branch allows both activities to continue.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
